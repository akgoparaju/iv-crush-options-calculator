python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Standards

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Include comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with meaningful messages
- **Logging**: Use appropriate logging levels for debugging and monitoring

### Code Organization

```python
# Good: Clear function with type hints and docstring
def calculate_calendar_spread(
    symbol: str, 
    front_expiration: str, 
    back_expiration: str,
    strike: float
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Calculate calendar spread metrics for given parameters.
    
    Args:
        symbol: Stock symbol (e.g., 'AAPL')
        front_expiration: Front month expiration date
        back_expiration: Back month expiration date  
        strike: Strike price for the calendar spread
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing spread analysis results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If invalid parameters provided
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: `snake_case` (e.g., `iv_crush_severity`)
- **Functions**: `snake_case` (e.g., `analyze_calendar_spread`)
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `OptionsAnalyzer`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_RISK_FREE_RATE`)
- **Files/Modules**: `snake_case` (e.g., `trade_construction.py`)

### Educational Code Requirements

- **Risk Disclaimers**: Include appropriate educational disclaimers
- **Clear Variable Names**: Use descriptive names that explain trading concepts
- **Educational Comments**: Explain complex trading logic for learning purposes
- **Validation**: Validate all financial calculations and assumptions

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Standards

- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
- **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions and data flow
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Demo Mode**: Ensure all features work in demo/educational mode

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the main test suite
python3 test_modular.py

# Run specific test modules (if applicable)
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Test with demo data
python3 main.py --demo --earnings --trade-construction --symbol AAPL
```

### Test Guidelines

- **Test Names**: Use descriptive names explaining what's being tested
- **Demo Data**: Use realistic but clearly fake data for testing
- **Error Testing**: Test error conditions and edge cases
- **Performance**: Include tests for performance-critical functions

### Example Test Structure

```python
def test_calendar_spread_calculation():
    """Test calendar spread calculation with valid inputs."""
    # Arrange
    test_data = create_demo_options_data()
    
    # Act
    result = analyze_calendar_spread(test_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result['net_debit'] > 0
    assert result['max_profit'] > result['net_debit']
    assert 'educational_disclaimer' in result
```
