Intro
0:00
what if I told you this option strategy
0:01
turned $10,000 into $1 million in just 1
0:04
year sounds insane right but I've
0:06
personally traded this strategy for over
0:08
9 years and in that time I've made over
0:10
6 million across my portfolio with this
0:12
strategy playing a major role in that
0:14
success in this video I'll break down
0:15
the data back tests and research behind
0:18
it showing you exactly why it works and
0:19
if you stick around until the end I'll
0:21
even give you the actual code calculator
0:23
and trade tracker so you can run the
0:24
numbers yourself I guarantee by that the
0:26
end of this video you'll not only
0:28
understand this strategy but you'll also
0:30
have a powerful new tool to add to your
0:31
trading Arsenal before we dive into the
0:33
strategy itself let's talk about
0:34
something far more important
What Is Edge In Trading?
0:36
understanding Edge because without Edge
0:38
no strategy no matter how well
0:40
structured will ever be profitable in
0:41
the long run so what exactly is Edge in
0:43
simple terms it's a repeatable
0:45
statistical advantage that gives you a
0:47
positive expectancy over time it's not
0:49
about winning every trade it's about
0:51
having a systematic process that when
0:52
executed consistently results in
0:54
profitability over a large number of
0:56
Trades but here's where most Traders go
0:58
wrong they confuse edge with luck or
1:00
random patterns and data just because
1:01
something worked a few times in back
1:03
tests does not mean it's an edge you
1:05
need a valid logical reason for why the
1:07
edge exists otherwise you're just Data
1:09
Mining and eventually the market will
1:11
correct itself leaving you with nothing
1:13
that brings up a critical question if
1:14
Edge is real why hasn't it been
1:16
arbitraged away by larger players after
1:18
all institutions have billions of
1:20
dollars and entire teams of quants
1:22
searching for inefficiencies so why can
1:23
I as an individual Trader still monetize
1:26
it the answer lies in understanding
1:27
where large players don't want to take
1:29
risks the best trade ideas come from
1:31
areas where other Market participants
1:32
are offloading risk at any cost they're
1:34
not trying to optimize for maximum
1:36
returns they're simply looking for
1:38
certainty and when people are desperate
1:39
for certainty they overpay for
1:41
protection creating inefficiencies we
1:43
can exploit but here's the key every
1:45
trade idea must be testable with data if
1:47
you can't quantify it you're just
1:48
gambling too many Traders operate on gut
1:50
feeling or intuition but if you don't
1:52
have a way to falsify bad ideas then all
1:54
you're doing is trading on Hope and hope
1:56
is not a strategy even when you find an
1:58
edge you have to accept that edges are
1:59
noisy they don't work every time and
2:01
results can vary in the short term this
2:03
is where most Traders fail they abandon
2:05
a good system during a draw down because
2:07
they don't understand the natural
2:08
variance of their strategy and that's
2:10
why research is so important if you
2:11
don't have the data to support your
2:12
strategy how will you know if you should
2:14
keep trading through a draw down or if
2:15
you're EDG just disappeared later in
2:17
this video I'll show you the data that
2:18
answers this exact question so what's
The Strategy
2:20
the strategy selling earnings volatility
2:24
that's it that's the strategy it sounds
2:26
simple but there's a lot of nuance we
2:28
will address with the data later in the
2:29
video it works because quarterly
2:31
earnings events which happen four times
2:33
a year per stock often account for the
2:35
majority of the volatility of stock will
2:37
experience in the entire year by selling
2:39
options ahead of earnings we aim to
2:41
profit from two key factors first is
2:43
what is commonly referred to as implied
2:44
volatility crush or IV Crush which is
2:46
the rapid drop in implied volatility
2:48
after earnings are announced the second
2:50
is stocks moving less than expected our
2:52
hope is that options tend to overprice
2:54
earnings moves and when the stock
2:55
doesn't move as much as anticipated we
2:57
profit from the discrepancy now why does
2:59
this Edge exist exist because people
3:01
hate uncertainty especially big
3:03
institutions and funds with tight risk
3:05
controls and uncertainty in a stock is
3:07
directly reflected in implied volatility
3:09
around earnings implied volatility
3:11
spikes because Traders funds and Retail
3:14
investors rush to buy protection many of
3:16
these participants aren't concerned with
3:17
whether implied volatility is over or
3:19
underpriced they just want to hedge
3:20
their positions we call them price
3:22
insensitive Traders and they create an
3:24
opportunity for us Beyond hedgers we
3:26
also have speculators Traders looking to
3:28
gamble on earnings moves they often by
3:30
short-term upside call options this
3:31
increased demand pushes options prices
3:33
and implied volatility even higher
3:35
further fueling our Edge when you
3:37
combine hedgers willing to overpay for
3:38
protection speculators driving up demand
3:40
for options and the general uncertainty
3:42
leading to higher implied volatility you
3:44
get a market imbalance where options are
3:46
systematically overpriced leading into
3:48
earnings and we can take the other side
3:49
of that trade now obviously this isn't
3:51
just Theory I'm going to back this up
3:52
with real data in the next section but
3:54
first let's talk about the best ways to
3:56
actually monetize this Edge using the
3:58
correct structure there are multiple
Structuring The Trade
3:59
ways to structure short volatility
4:01
trades around earnings but I focus on
4:02
two the short straddle and the long
4:04
calendar spread let's break them down
4:05
the short straddle is the most common
4:07
short volatility strategy it involves
4:09
selling one call and one put of the same
4:11
strike and same expiration generally
4:13
this will be the at the money strike
4:14
this means we profit when the stock
4:16
moves less than the expected earnings
4:17
move and when implied volatility
4:19
collapses post earnings however because
4:21
we are selling short-term options gamma
4:23
risk is very high gamma measures how
4:25
fast Delta changes and near earnings
4:27
with inflated implied volatility and
4:29
short time to expiration gamma is
4:31
extremely sensitive if the stock moves
4:32
more than expected our Vega gains from
4:34
IV Crush won't be enough to offset the
4:36
loss from gamma and we can take a big
4:38
hit the long calendar spread involves
4:40
selling a near-term also known as front
4:42
month option and buying a longer term
4:44
also known as back month option at the
4:46
same strike it is usually executed with
4:48
the shared strike being the at the money
4:50
strike it is a debit strategy because
4:51
the option we are buying in the back
4:53
will be more expensive in dollar terms
4:55
than the one in the front typically I
4:57
use a 30-day expiration Gap because it
4:59
maximized exposure to earnings
5:00
volatility while keeping the structure
5:02
stable now here's where people get
5:03
confused a calendar is technically long
5:05
Vega but this is misleading the backmon
5:07
option has more Vega than the front
5:09
month making it seem like we want IV to
5:11
rise but in reality what we want is IV
5:13
to drop in the front month more than it
5:15
does in the back month essentially we
5:17
want our Vega gains in the front
5:19
contract to offset our Vega loss in the
5:21
back we are also short gamma because the
5:23
option we sold in the front has a higher
5:25
negative gamma than the positive gamma
5:26
of the option we bought in the back this
5:28
means we want the stock to move as
5:29
little as possible making it so our
5:31
gamma losses in the front are as small
5:32
as possible since the back month
5:34
positive gamma will not be able to
5:35
compensate lowering front month implied
5:37
volatility raises our profitability but
5:40
if backmon implied volatility also drops
5:42
significantly our structure collapses in
5:44
limiting profits through testing I found
5:47
that a 30-day difference minimizes this
5:49
issue so which one is better the
5:50
straddle offers higher potential returns
5:52
and lower commissions but also has
5:54
higher tail risk meaning when things go
5:56
wrong they go very wrong the calendar
5:58
offers better risk control and a
5:59
smoother Equity curve but it generally
6:01
has lower returns that's why in the data
6:03
section I'm going to break down exactly
6:05
which structure performs better over
6:06
time based on thousands of historical
The Dataset
6:08
earnings events now let's dive into the
6:10
numbers everything I'm about to show you
6:11
is backed by real historical Market data
6:13
no cherry picking just raw numbers and
6:16
Analysis we're working with a data set
6:17
of 4500 unique stocks spanning from 2007
6:21
to today covering a total of
6:23
72,500 earnings events now within the
6:26
data set we track several key metrics
6:28
both predictor variables which help us
6:30
determine when to enter a trade and
6:31
Target variables which measure the
6:33
success of each strategy the key
6:34
predictor variables are the term
6:36
structure slopes this measures the
6:38
steepness of the implied volatility term
6:40
structure specifically it looks at the
6:41
difference in implied volatilities
6:43
between the front month or near-term
6:44
expirations and further out expirations
6:47
of 45 days or higher a steeper structure
6:49
will show that near-term options expect
6:51
large moves but they expect volatility
6:53
to fall back to normal levels over time
6:55
there's also the term structure ratios
6:57
similar to the term structure slope but
6:58
expressed as a ratio rather than a slope
7:00
there's also a 30-day average volume
7:02
which is our liquidity measure this will
7:04
help us determine if liquidity plays a
7:06
role in pricing of earnings events and
7:07
finally there is IV RV ratios so
7:10
comparing implied volatility to realized
7:11
volatility over the period prior to
7:14
earnings this is used to see if there's
7:15
any predictability coming from implied
7:17
volatility being overpriced in the time
7:19
before earnings now let's move on to our
7:20
Target variables which measure how our
7:22
strategy performed we analyzed three
7:24
primary Return base metrics note that
7:26
all of these positions were open 15
7:28
minutes before the close of the trading
7:30
period prior to the earnings
7:31
announcement the first we call straddle
7:33
return jump it is the return of the
7:35
trade closed 15 minutes into the trading
7:37
session after earnings we also have
7:39
straddle return move which is the return
7:41
if we close the position with 15 minutes
7:43
before Market close on the day after
7:45
earnings and the calendar return jump
7:47
which is the return of the calendar
7:48
spread close 15 minutes into the
7:49
training session after earnings all of
7:51
these include realistic training costs
7:53
including interactive brokers
7:54
commissions and slippage estimates based
7:56
on bid ass spreads and volume this
7:58
ensures that everything analyzing
8:00
reflects Real World Trading conditions
8:01
not just theoretical models let's look
8:03
at the distribution of returns for the
8:04
straddle jump strategy when we plot the
8:06
historical returns for the straddle jump
8:08
we immediately see something striking
8:09
most returns cluster around small
8:11
profits but there's a long dangerous
8:13
left tail where rare but massive losses
8:15
occur in fact 1% of the time this
8:18
strategy lost 130% or more and. 1% of
8:21
the time it lost over
8:23
41% there's even one extreme outlier
8:25
where the straddle lost over 9200 on a
8:28
single trade we can also notice the near
8:30
0% mean return indicating that trading
8:32
all events blindly will just break even
8:34
over time this is generally expected and
8:36
shows that on average the market prices
8:38
earnings events quite well now let's
8:40
compare this to the calendar jump
8:41
strategy the Calendar's distribution
8:42
looks far more stable lots of small
8:44
consistent winners and fewer extreme
8:46
losses the worst case scenario for the
8:48
calendar is losing the entire debit paid
8:50
we also noticed the near 0% mean return
8:52
here showing me break even if we just
8:54
blindly traded all events now how did
8:56
these strategies perform quarter by
8:57
quarter the stradle jump returns fluctu
8:59
traded wildly around the zero line
9:01
showing no consistent long-term Edge
9:02
when traded blindly the calendar spread
9:04
also showed random fluctuations around
9:06
the zero line showing that if trading
9:07
all events there is no real long-term
9:09
Edge there this is why we have predictor
9:11
variables to see if we can improve this
9:12
Fact one interesting observation is the
9:14
move straddle held until near close the
9:16
next day was a consistent loser
9:18
confirming the well-documented post
9:20
earnings announcement drift effect post
Aside: Post Earnings Announcement Drift
9:22
earnings announcement drift is a
9:24
well-documented market phenomenon that
9:25
results in prices reacting to earnings
9:27
announcements slowly over time this
9:29
means that for example if a stock jumped
9:31
5% in the morning after earnings it is
9:33
more likely to continue to rise
9:35
throughout the day this means you could
9:36
sell the position in the morning after
9:38
the jump and take the opposite position
9:40
or use shares to ride the predictable
9:42
change if you want a deep dive on post
9:43
earnings announcement drift and how to
9:45
trade it let me know in the comments
9:46
because the jump shows more promise here
9:48
we will only consider that for the rest
9:50
of the video I just wanted to point out
9:51
the post earnings announcement drift
9:53
effect that happens with earnings so do
Do Our Predictor Variables Predict?
9:55
any of our factors actually predict
9:56
profitable trades when we split the data
9:58
into desiles which is 10 equal groups
10:00
based on each predictor variable we
10:02
found three factors that correlated
10:04
strongly with success the term structure
10:05
slope specifically the nearest
10:07
expiration to the 45-day expiration the
10:09
more negative the slope the higher the
10:11
returns for both the straddle and the
10:13
calendar essentially the steeper the
10:14
implied volatility curve the more
10:16
overpriced short-term options tend to be
10:18
this shape of the slope is often
10:19
referred to as backwardation this means
10:21
the near-term options are more
10:23
overpriced in IV terms than later term
10:25
ones the market expects volatility to
10:27
drop back to normal levels after the
10:29
event the 30-day average volume higher
10:31
pre-earnings trading volume led to
10:32
better returns for both the straddle and
10:34
the calendar this suggests that more
10:36
volume or more participants will lead to
10:38
a higher level of price insensitivity
10:40
where demand is more likely to outpace
10:42
supply and finally the iv30 rv30 ratio
10:44
the higher this ratio the better the
10:46
expected return this confirms that if
10:48
implied volatility was overpriced in
10:49
normal conditions it was even more
10:51
likely to be overpriced for earnings
The Model
10:53
with all this analysis we built a simple
10:55
rule-based model that only trades when
10:57
term structure slope is sufficiently
10:58
negative the 30-day average volume is
11:00
above a key threshold and the iv30 rv30
11:04
is high enough to indicate implied Vol
11:05
overpricing this filtered out 88% of
11:07
events for the straddle and 90% of
11:09
events for the calendar leaving us with
11:11
only the highest quality trades the
11:12
final results of the model is that the
11:14
straddle mean return became + 9% up from
11:17
zero but with a high variance 48%
11:19
stering deviation and the calendar mean
11:21
return got up to 7.3% up from zero with
11:24
a lower variance of a 28% standard
11:26
deviation the straddle had a Max loss of
11:28
8 130% where the calendar had a Max loss
11:32
of 105% with the extra 5% being due to
11:35
commissions both strategies were
11:36
profitable but the calendar was much
11:38
more stable making it easier to trade
11:39
consistently so after analyzing over
11:41
72,500 earnings events we now have a
11:44
data back trading strategy with clearly
11:45
defined edges but this alone isn't
11:47
enough we still need to test how this
11:49
strategy would perform in several
11:51
scenarios including what position size
11:53
to use in the next section I'll walk
11:54
through a Monte Carlo simulation to show
11:56
the potential growth draw down win rates
11:59
and and more metrics you can expect when
12:00
trading this strategy now let's dive
12:02
into the results of both these models
12:04
first we'll analyze the Kelly Criterion
Kelly Criterion
12:06
which determines the optimal fraction of
12:08
your portfolio to allocate to each trade
12:10
theoretically Kelly sizing maximizes
12:12
long-term growth but in practice full
12:14
Kelly is almost always too aggressive
12:16
leading to extreme volatility and an
12:17
uncomfortably high risk of bankruptcy
12:19
for the straddle the suggested Kelly
12:21
fraction is 6.5% meaning if you had a
12:23
$10,000 account it recommends selling a
12:25
straddle with a maximum of $650 in
12:28
collected premium for the calendar the
12:30
Kelly fraction is 60% meaning the
12:32
recommended position size would be a
12:33
$6,000 debit right away using the Kelly
12:36
fraction as a proxy for the better
12:37
strategy this suggests that the calendar
12:39
structure is likely superior but here's
12:41
where it gets interesting for the
12:42
calendar 100% losses aren't rare even
12:44
60% is far too high I'll show exactly
12:47
why this is in a moment but just looking
12:48
at these numbers the calendar appears to
12:50
be the safer bet as it recommends a much
12:52
higher fractional allocation however
12:54
before we can draw any conclusions let's
12:55
analyze this further now I don't just
Monte Carlo Simulation
12:57
rely on back tests I run Monte Carlo
13:00
simulations to get a better picture of
13:01
real world variants why because back
13:04
tests only show one historical path
13:06
while Monte Carlo runs thousands of
13:08
different possible outcomes by randomly
13:10
sampling from the data set this gives us
13:11
a far better idea of what could happen
13:13
in the future and whether our strategy
13:15
holds up across many different market
13:16
conditions these simulations are also a
13:18
great way to validate whether our live
13:20
trading results are within the expected
13:21
range now let's break down the actual
13:23
mon Carlo results before we get started
13:25
though I highly recommend you download
13:26
the resources Linked In the description
13:28
you'll find a PDF containing all the key
13:30
data and figures I'll be discussing that
13:31
way you can follow along and reference
13:33
it later as you analyze the strategy for
13:35
yourself for this study I ran 10,000
13:37
simulated p&l paths over a span of 1,000
13:39
trading days which is about 4 years and
13:41
another batch over 252 trading days
13:44
which is 1 year all starting with a
13:45
$10,000 portfolio these simulations give
13:47
us a much broader picture of potential
13:49
outcomes than a single back test ever
13:50
could let's start by looking at the full
Full Kelly Simulation Results
13:52
Kelly BET for the stratal strategy which
13:53
came out to 6.5% per trade from the
13:56
simulation we see no bankruptcies and
13:58
some pass even managed to hit a couple
13:59
million dollars in returns over 4 years
14:01
sounds great right not so fast when we
14:04
examine the draw down histogram we can
14:05
see a big problem about 35% of all paths
14:08
experience a Max draw down of over 45%
14:11
with some paths dropping as low as 80%
14:13
that means that at some point during
14:14
these four years more than a third of
14:16
Traders would have seen nearly half
14:18
their Capital wiped out or worse and if
14:20
we look at the longest draw down
14:21
duration most of them lasted between 200
14:23
trading days which means that if you hit
14:25
a rough patch you could be seen in the
14:26
red for months before seeing a recovery
14:29
now ask yourself can you stomach seni
14:30
your account drop by 45% or more can you
14:32
keep executing the strategy after losing
14:34
80% of your Capital even though the
14:36
average outcome after 4 years is around
14:38
$2 million some traders in this
14:40
situation would still have less than
14:41
$100,000 after the same period This is
14:44
why trading size is so important the
14:45
variance is real and if you don't
14:47
control risk you won't survive long
14:48
enough to see the gains now let's shift
14:50
to the calendar strategy at full Kelly
14:52
which came out to much higher 60% bet
14:54
per trade the results 485 bankruptcies
14:57
out of the 10,000 paths that's about 5%
14:59
of all accounts going to zero not only
15:01
that but when we check the draw down
15:03
histogram we see an even more troubling
15:05
Trend many of the draw Downs are in the
15:06
80 to 95% range and the biggest warning
15:09
sign the distribution of draw Downs is
15:11
skewed heavily towards 100 meaning that
15:13
at this bet size you would eventually
15:15
get wiped out if you traded long enough
15:16
this tells us one thing Bening at full
15:18
Kelly has way too much variance however
10k to $1 Million
15:21
because of this aggressive sizing this
15:22
strategy was able to turn $10,000 into
15:25
over $1 million in a few paths in under
15:28
a year that's how the crazy back test
15:29
results in the title happen but here's
15:31
the catch this size will eventually lead
15:33
to bankruptcy period I would never trade
15:35
at this size and I strongly recommend
15:36
against it but if you're willing to risk
15:38
everything for the shot at massive
15:39
returns that's your choice let's use
Fractional Kelly Simulation Results
15:41
fractional Kelly going forward
15:42
fractional Kelly bets let us reduce our
15:44
variance while not reducing returns by
15:46
as much for instance half or 50% Kelly
15:49
reduces variance by 50% but only reduces
15:52
returns by 25% so let's scale back to
15:54
something more reasonable let's try a
15:55
30% Kelly BET for the straddle this
15:57
means dropping down to around 2% per
15:59
trade after 4 years the mean portfolio
16:01
size drops but the Max draw down also
16:03
drops significantly the largest draw
16:05
down is now around 37% and the average
16:07
Max draw down is only 15% which is much
16:10
more manageable the mean sharp ratio
16:12
over the 4 years is around 3% which is
16:14
excellent for the calendar strategy we
16:16
take the 30% Kelly BET which translates
16:18
into around 18% per trade the return
16:20
graph looks really strong but the draw
16:22
Downs are still too high for My Lying
16:24
the max is around 76% with the mean
16:26
around 40% which is too high for me so I
16:28
reduce it further to around a 10% Kelly
16:30
which is 6% per trade and this finally
16:32
brought the draw Downs in line with what
16:34
I look for in a sustainable strategy at
16:36
this level the sharp ratio was actually
16:38
higher than the straddle which is why
16:40
this is the structure I personally
Straddle vs Calendar
16:41
prefer to trade between these two
16:42
structures both are viable but for me
16:44
the calendar strategy is better balance
16:46
of risk and reward I've seen too many
16:48
earnings events that move way more than
16:50
expected where straddle would have
16:51
resulted in a devastating loss so
16:53
despite the straddle offering
16:54
potentially higher returns for my sanity
16:56
and preservation of capital I trade the
16:58
C Cal let's now take a long-term view
Long Term Simulation of Strategy
17:00
over 10 years starting with $10,000
17:02
trading the calendar strategy at 10%
17:04
Kelly the mean ending portfolio value is
17:06
around $6 million this equates to a
17:08
compound annual growth rate of around
17:10
90% The Max draw down distribution sees
17:13
a mean Max draw down of around 20% a
17:15
mean longest draw down of around 6
17:16
months the win rate is 66% the
17:19
expectancy per trade is 265 and the mean
17:23
sharp ratio is 3 and 1/2 overall this
17:25
strategy performs extremely well but
17:27
like I said earlier position sizing is
17:29
everything no matter how strong an edge
17:31
is if you size too aggressively you will
17:33
blow up risk management is the key to
17:35
longevity and preserving capital is
17:37
always the number one priority in the
Live Trade Example
17:39
files I shared in the description I've
17:40
shared a python script that allows you
17:41
to scan earnings events that fit the
17:43
criteria we've discussed you'll find a
17:45
detailed document on how to set it up
17:47
and run it at the link in the
17:48
description here's how it works you
17:49
enter a ticker with an upcoming earnings
17:51
event and the program calculates all the
17:53
key metrics from our model it then
17:54
provides a recommendation based on the
17:56
data if all three conditions are met it
17:58
Flags the trade as is recommend if only
17:59
two are met but one of them is the term
18:01
structure slope it marks it as consider
18:03
if the term structure slope is not met
18:05
the trade is automatically labeled AV
18:07
void I personally only trade the
18:08
recommended setups but that choice is up
18:10
to you now let's run the script and see
18:12
what we get looking at Amazon they have
18:13
earnings tomorrow and the model confirms
18:15
that this is a green recommended setup
18:17
that means all conditions are met and it
18:18
qualifies as a high probability trade so
18:20
I executed the trade I opened a February
18:22
7th March 7th call calendar for a
18:26
$3.33 debit the following morning about
18:28
15 minutes into the market open Amazon
18:30
had moved only 2 1/2% which was well
18:33
below the expected move priced into the
18:35
options Market as a result the position
18:37
worked exactly as I wanted and I closed
18:38
for a nice profit of $9,300 now if you
18:41
look at the straddle trade which I
18:42
didn't take you'll see it actually made
18:44
even more while trading fewer contracts
18:46
20 contracts for the straddle versus 100
18:48
contracts for the calendar this aligns
18:50
with what we expect the straddle has
18:52
less commissions and the straddle has
18:53
higher potential returns when things go
18:55
well but when things go really bad the
18:57
calendar position takes a hit while the
18:58
straddle can get absolutely crushed with
19:01
massive losses this is exactly why risk
19:03
management is key and why I personally
19:04
prefer the calendar structure for this
19:06
strategy it offers a better balance of
19:07
risk and reward if you want to run these
19:09
calculations yourself grab the python
19:11
script and setup guide in the
19:12
description and test it on upcoming
19:13
earnings events if you made it to the
